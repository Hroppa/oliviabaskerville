# Doctoral Research

## Collecting the Nation: National Identity and the Circulation of Medieval Manuscripts in Britain, 1900-1939

### Project Overview

My doctoral research interrogates how medieval manuscripts were transformed into symbols of national identity in early twentieth-century Britain. This transformation occurred during a unique historical convergence:

* The First World War and rising nationalism in western Europe
* The 'Golden Age of Collecting' in the international art market
* The professionalisation of museum curatorship and historical studies

The project examines how pre-modern, handmade books were understood to represent the modern nation.

### Research Questions

My thesis investigates several key questions:

* How did medieval books transition from historical sources to embodiments of national identity?
* Who had the cultural authority to claim particular books were essential for the nation?
* What assumptions underpinned these claims of national importance?
* How did the British Museum's collection become seen as the natural place for their preservation?
* What relationship did these books have to the telling of national history?

### Methodology

The research analyzes rhetorical discourse about manuscript books of 'national importance' across multiple contexts:

* Private correspondence
* Public debate
* Museum acquisition records
* Press coverage
* Institutional archives
