# Welcome

<p class="dropcap">
I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the School of Advanced Study, University of London, researching the intersection of national identity and medieval manuscripts in early twentieth-century Britain.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">
My research examines how medieval manuscripts transformed from historical sources into embodiments of national identity.
</div>

## Research Focus

<p class="dropcap">
My doctoral project investigates how pre-modern manuscript codices, acquired by the British Museum between 1900 and 1939, were rhetorically justified as objects of 'national importance'. This period, known as the 'Golden Age of Collecting', saw unprecedented circulation of medieval manuscripts amid rising nationalism in western Europe.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">
The early 20th century saw medieval manuscripts shift from being valued primarily for their text or images to being presented as material objects of national heritage.
</div>

## Current Work

I am in the final year of my Ph.D., working on completing my thesis which examines how medieval manuscripts became symbols of English national identity during a pivotal period of British imperial might. My research combines approaches from:

* Material culture studies
* Art history
* Museum studies
* Nationalism studies
* Medieval historiography


## Research Supervision

I am supervised by:
* Dr Laura Cleaver – Senior Lecturer in Manuscript Studies
* Prof Julia Crick – Professor of Palaeography and Manuscript Studies (KCL)
