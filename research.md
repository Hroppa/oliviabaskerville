# Doctoral Research

## Collecting the Nation: National Identity and the Circulation of Medieval Manuscripts in Britain, 1900-1939

<p class="dropcap">
My doctoral research interrogates how medieval manuscripts were transformed into symbols of national identity in early twentieth-century Britain. This transformation occurred during a unique historical convergence:
</p>

* The First World War and rising nationalism in western Europe
* The 'Golden Age of Collecting' in the international art market
* The professionalisation of museum curatorship and historical studies

## Research Questions

<div class="sidenote">
The project examines how pre-modern, handmade books were understood to represent the modern nation.
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
My thesis investigates several key questions: how medieval books transitioned from historical sources to embodiments of national identity; who had the cultural authority to claim particular books were essential for the nation; what assumptions underpinned these claims of national importance; how the British Museum's collection became seen as the natural place for their preservation; and what relationship these books had to the telling of national history.
</p>

## Methodology

<p class="dropcap">
The research analyzes rhetorical discourse about manuscript books of 'national importance' across multiple contexts:
</p>

* Private correspondence
* Public debate
* Museum acquisition records
* Press coverage
* Institutional archives
