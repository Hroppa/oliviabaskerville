## Current Research

My doctoral project stands at the crossroads of material culture studies and art history, examining pre-modern manuscript codices acquired by the British Museum between 1900 and 1939. This research investigates how these manuscripts were rhetorically justified as objects of 'national importance' during a period of rising nationalism and unprecedented art market activity.

<div class="sidenote">
The early 20th century saw the convergence of nationalism, the 'Golden Age of Collecting,' and the professionalisation of museum practices.
