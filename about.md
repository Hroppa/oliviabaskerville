## Current Research

<p class="dropcap">
My doctoral project stands at the crossroads of material culture studies and art history, examining pre-modern manuscript codices acquired by the British Museum between 1900 and 1939. This research investigates how these manuscripts were rhetorically justified as objects of 'national importance' during a period of rising nationalism and unprecedented art market activity.
